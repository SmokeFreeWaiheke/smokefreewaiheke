<p>Lets be clear, our concern is about <em>everyone&rsquo;s</em> health. Current government and council policy is focused on reducing overall smoking by:</p>
<ul>
<li>getting people to quit</li>
<li>making tobacco products harder to obtain.</li>
</ul>
<p>However we feel that this doesn&rsquo;t help the 85% of the population who do not smoke, don&rsquo;t want to be affected by other people&rsquo;s smoke and have no powers to prevent people smoking in public or preventing smoke from drifting into their homes.</p>
<p>This is not a place to beat up on smokers as people. We know they have been addicted to nicotine by giant commercial interests and its very hard to give up - we get that. There are lots of resources for people who want to quit. However, There are very few resources for people whose lives are negatively impacted by second hand smoke. Some feedback I have had is that authorities either don&rsquo;t care, or just shrug that this is in the too hard basket. This is a place for people who care about how you&rsquo;ve been affected by SHS.</p>
<p>Tobacco Smoke pollutes the air with smoke particles and noxious chemicals that have been repeatedly shown to have serious negative health effects on people exposed to second hand smoke. - Please post links to articles that objectively measure these impacts.</p>
<p>Private individuals should have a right established in law to ensure that air they breath is not polluted with tobacco smoke. In particular the right to not have tobacco smoke drift onto their property or into their private homes. - Please post about how smoke drift affects you, your family and pets, your health etc.</p>
<p>In respect of private property there is a conflict between a smoker&rsquo;s right to the &lsquo;free and quiet enjoyment of their property&rsquo; and that of a neighbouring non-smoker, their children and pets to enjoy smoke free air. Currently in this conflict the smoker has no legal responsibility to ensure that their tobacco smoke is contained on their own property. - how can we work together to create a cultural shift so that responsibility falls upon the polluter.</p>
<p>In recent years we have seen some legal action around places like condos, and rented apartments on smoke drift between units. The key here is that there is someone to complain to - a body corp, landlords etc. However in many places smokers are on their own property or on the street and nearby households are still negatively affected. In the home you can&rsquo;t just move away.</p>
<p>Tobacco smoke is a notable exception from existing laws and bylaws (in various countries) that prohibit the burning of treated wood that contain many of the same poisonous chemicals to tobacco smoke; that require wood fires to meet pollution requirements and those that define nuisance for other irritants that cross boundaries. e.g. loud music, bonfires, odours etc.</p>
<p>Some families still expose their children and pets to second hand smoke causing long term health issues. - What can those affected do?</p>
