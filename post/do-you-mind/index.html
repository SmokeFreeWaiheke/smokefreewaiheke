<p>The more accurate question is, <em>&ldquo;Do you mind if I expose you to another load of arsenic and other toxins along with the nicotine, knowing that you will probably experience more forced tobacco smoke exposure today and every other day just going about your daily life, which contributes to the high statistics of preventable smoke-related deaths and diseases?"</em> Or more succinctly, <em>&ldquo;Do you mind if I contribute to shortening your life?"</em>  Another question that is not asked is, <em>&ldquo;Do you have any health problems that are triggered or made worse by exposure to tobacco smoke?"</em></p>
<p>The question itself is meant to shift responsibility from the smoker to the non-smoker, forcing an uncomfortable face-to-face social confrontation in which the non-smoker is pressured to be okay with smoking, regardless of harm to themselves. This leads to the defence that permission was granted.</p>
<p>The implication is that non-smokers have willingly conceded their right to breathe clean and taken on the responsibility for the future health problems cause by tobacco smoke.</p>
<p>Often a gesture is made to move a few steps away, or to wave the tobacco smoke around in the air. This half-hearted measure is just theatre. If anyone in the area can smell the smoke, they are impacted. The gesture shifts responsibility onto the non-smoker again to be okay with exposure, because an effort was made to reduce the tobacco smoke drift. Such ineffectual actions head off the real issue which is that tobacco smoke is incompatable with socialising.</p>
<p>Tobacco smoke is unique among addictive habits because everyone who can smell the smoke receives a toxic load and there is no safe level of exposure to tobacco smoke. No one wants the responsibility of telling someone else what they should or should not do with their own life. Therefore it falls on government to enforce (literally) far-reaching protections for the sake of the non-smoking public.</p>
<p>The tobacco industry has worked for decades to suppress research and block government tobacco control regulations. Those with a smoking habit are the human shield the tobacco industry uses to avoid being drummed out of business. They  keep up pressure for the fiction of &lsquo;smokers&rsquo; rights' and avoid comprehensive smoking bans.</p>
<p>But we have a salutary model of comprehensive smoking ban in the NZ Prison System. In response to lawsuits from prison employees, the government back in 2010 decided to simply ban tobacco products in prison. Madness and mayhem were predicted. Staff prepared for riots. Who ever heard of smokefree prisons? We grew up connecting prison with the cigarette trade. Instead, inmates spoke of the freedom and support to quit smoking and began asking their whanau at home to quit as well.</p>
<p>A comprehensive ban is probably not feasible outside of the prison system. Because of this, it is imperative that health agencies and government bodies must protect everyone from tobacco smoke drift by making it the smoker&rsquo;s responsibility to ensure that non one is near the path of smoke drift caused by their smoking. Only that action will achieve the necessary health outcomes where smokers only harm themselves and not those around them. On a windy day this would mean a very restrictive environment</p>
<p>Tobacco smoke must be treated as the toxic air pollution it is well-proven to be.</p>
