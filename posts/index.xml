Oh so you can smell my tobacco smoke, don&amp;rsquo;t worry its: just vapour, not dangerous, too dilute to cause a problem, doesn&amp;rsquo;t affect you, will pass by in a moment. Or you can - always move away, close a window, turn on a fan etc. etc.
There&amp;rsquo;s a prevalent idea that only long term exposure is a risk factor.</description></item><item><title>Welcome</title><link>//smokefreewaiheke.org.nz/posts/welcome/</link><pubDate>Mon, 12 Jul 2021 18:23:13 +1200</pubDate><guid>//smokefreewaiheke.org.nz/posts/welcome/</guid><description>You are responsible for the impact of your tobacco smoke This community is for anyone affected by Second Hand Smoke, Smoke Drift, vapes, etc. In fact any situation where someone else&amp;rsquo;s voluntary, recreational activities create pollution that affects your own personal space.
