## Being taken seriously

It seems the first hurdle that people affected by SHS encounter is various forms of denial. Oh so you can smell my tobacco smoke, don't worry its: just vapour, not dangerous, too dilute to cause a problem, doesn't affect you, will pass by in a moment. Or you can - always move away, close a window, turn on a fan etc. etc.

There's a prevalent idea that only long term exposure is a risk factor. That is not necessarily the case. Its difficult to prove causality at a legal level. it took many years to 'prove' the link between smoking and cancer and other diseases. Mainly because the impacts are cumulative and develop over time. However, exposure to airborne pollutants also generates an immediate measurable inflammatory effect. You should not have to wait until you die from cancer or have a severe asthma attack before you can say - 'I told you so'. It should be enough that you don't want to breath someone else's recreational smoke.

According to the U.S. Surgeon General, there is no risk-free level of exposure to secondhand smoke. That means if you can smell cigarette smoke in the air, it could be harming your health.
