Smokefree Waiheke is working to protect non-smokers from involuntary exposure to second and third hand smoke (SHS/THS)

Our goal is that 100% of people are protected and empowered by smokefree policies.

The tobacco industry contributes to about 6 million deaths globally - that's more than the total COVID-19 deaths - every year. According to the governments own statistics in New Zealand approximately 500 people die prematurely due to second-hand smoke.

We support more permissive land use regulations in order to increase the housing supply. We believe that these have to be matched by stronger powers to avoid negative health impacts arising from higher density housing and pollution.

Secondhand smoke is the combination of smoke from the burning end of a cigarette and the smoke breathed out by smokers. Secondhand smoke contains more than 7,000 chemicals. Hundreds are toxic and about 70 cause cancer. Thirdhand smoke is the remnants of that smoke that clings to clothing, buildings, furnishings etc.

Second hand smoke Causes increases in heart rate, blood pressure and increased risk of heart attack, asthma and cancer in those impacted. It is also unpleasant and acts as an assault on peoples right to live in a clean atmosphere.

According to the US CDC and many other organisations. There is no risk-free level of exposure to secondhand smoke.

In 2007, WHO released a report entitled Protection from Exposure to Secondhand Tobacco Smoke: Policy Recommendations.3 In light of the available scientific evidence on ventilation, the report made the following recommendation:
“Remove the pollutant—tobacco smoke—by implementing 100% smokefree environments.

The Medium density residential standards will place balconies, decks, windows, common ventilation systems, smaller private outlook spaces and private outdoor living spaces in closer proximity to other dwellings and adjacent properties.

In existing larger scale buildings such as tower blocks. A body corporate or other legal entity can act to establish and police a smoke free environment - at the very least it gives a tenant someone to complain to. In New South Wales and California tenants have successfully won judgements against body corporates against smoke drift from neighbouring apartments and lots.

In the type of buildings enabled by the proposals there is may be no such overarching body.

For this reason we wish to see the act specify that tobacco smoke (and other similar pollutants such as cannabis, vaping etc) be explicitly identified as both hazardous and nuisance and that people affected by such smoke ( in any amount) have the full power of the law to enforce the cessation of the smoke drift.

This right to not be impacted by another person's tobacco smoke should be effective wherever smoke - Drifts across private title boundaries - Drifts between multiple dwellings on a single title or apartments in a block - Is present in any public or common residential area, including decks, gardens, driveways, garages etc.

We would point out that loud music can be annoying and often affects neighbouring properties. Local councils have practical bylaws and the ability to issue fines and cease and desist notices to consistent offenders. Music can be annoying, affecting the peaceful enjoyment of one's property. It can cause stress, sleeplessness and can be loud or persistent enough to be considered an assault. In serious cases the police will turn up and ask you to stop.

None of this currently applies to Smoke Drift. Even though this is a measurable harm.

We request that the government use the opportunity of these changes to give people impacted by second hand smoke real powers to protect their environment and breath clean air. Where ever that may be. This proposal is in line with the Governments own policy of establishing a Smoke free Aotearoa by 2025.

We also propose that all new buildings permitted under the amended RMA be required to be fully and permanently smoke free. - This is no different to existing health and safety requirements for sanitation, clean water, and insulation.
