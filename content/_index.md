Are you affected by Second Hand Smoke, Tobacco Smoke Drift, Vapes?

Does someone else's voluntary, recreational activities create pollution impact your environment, health and wellbeing?

Do you believe that smokers need to take responsibility for their impact on others?

Will you work with the Waiheke community to remove tobacco smoke from our environment?

## Smokers need to be responsible for the impact of their tobacco smoke

Our concern is about _everyone's_ health. Current government and council policy is focused on reducing overall smoking by:

* getting people to quit
* making tobacco products harder to obtain.

However we feel that this doesn't help the 85% of the population who do not smoke, don't want to be affected by other people's smoke and have no powers to prevent people smoking in public or preventing smoke from drifting into their homes.
